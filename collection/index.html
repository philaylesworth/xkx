    <h1>My Virtual Motorcycle Collection</h1>
    <p>
      I would love to have a garage full of motorcycles. The only problem is
      that I only ride about 10,000km a year. Oh yeah, I really don't enjoy
      tinkering with old bikes, either. And, I really like how newer, fuel
      injected bikes just start, no matter how cold it is. So, I am not a
      collector but that doesn't mean I don't lust for every cool bike I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      This virtual collection is my answer to that dilemma. I can have all the
      bikes I desire, stored in one safe place, and I never have to service or
      wash them!
